# Android Basics: User Input


[Android Basics: User Input](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-user-input--ud836) is the second course of the five Android Basics courses. Learn to make your app more interactive by using buttons, and changing texts, reinforce xml, and get started with Java.

By the end of this course you will have developed one coffee-ordering app and a basketball score app.

# Coffee Order
This is the first app you will develop, order a coffee by clicking on the plus or minus sign, this updates a TextView that shows the quantity of coffees you are ordering. Depending on that quantity it calculates a total price value that will also update when you modify the quantity of coffees you desire to order. Finally, an order button that will pop-up a message saying that your order has been successfully registered, this was implemented using a Toast, feel free to do some research about this if you are interested because it is not implemented or explained in the course.
