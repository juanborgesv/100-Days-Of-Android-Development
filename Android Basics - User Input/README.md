# Android Basics: User Input

[Android Basics: User Input](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-user-input--ud836) is the second course of the five Android Basics courses. Learn to make your app more interactive by using buttons, and changing texts, reinforce xml, and get started with Java.

By the end of this course you will have developed one coffee-ordering app and a basketball score app. Every project has its own screenshot folder, where you can see the course version screenshot which is what the instructor tell the students to do, and then there is my version with the same features but with my own design. If your are doing the course too I highly recommend you to do your own design of the projects, it will be very challenging and satisfying at the end.

## Coffee-Ordering App
This is the first app you will develop, order a coffee by clicking on the plus or minus sign, this updates a TextView that shows the quantity of coffees you are ordering. Depending on that quantity it calculates a total price value that will also update when you modify the quantity of coffees you desire to order. Finally, an order button that will pop-up a message saying that your order has been successfully registered, this was implemented using a Toast, feel free to do some research about this if you are interested because it is not implemented or explained in the course.

## Basketball Score Manager App

The second app is more challenging to develop but it reinforces the concepts explained before and the process that took you to develop the first project. This app consists in modify a Basketball Team Score using three buttons, +3 Points Button, +2 Points Button and Free Throw Button. You might guess what each button does, each one adds different amount of points to the current score, lastly there is a button that will reset the score. Seems different than the first project but at the end by using a Button you will change a TextView, just like the Coffee-Ordering App.
