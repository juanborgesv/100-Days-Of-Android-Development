# 100 Days Of Android Development - Log

## Day 0: July 11, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge.

**Thoughts:** Hope this will help me to get focused as far as possible.

## Day 1: July 12, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have completed the course Android Basics: User Interface recently, but did not do the project, so today I focused on doing it and try using EditTexts.

**Thoughts:** Include an EditText was easy, but I had to do some research to hide the underline and cursor when the user is not typing  for the first time.

## Day 2: July 13, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have completed the first project, a Coffee-Ordering App recently (Android Basics: User Input), but did not like the graphical final result, so I design a similar app with the same features, innovating with an image, more group layouts, and doing some research about the icon app, colors.xml and styles.xml

**Thoughts:** Importing images sometimes can't work well, when importing a really big one and set it to an ImageView I got some errors that took sometime to find what was causing the problem and fix it. Using the [Android Developer Documentation](https://developer.android.com/docs/) helped me to change the default colors of the top blue bar that every new android project has, creating a new feature called Toast, and setting up an icon app image.

## Day 3: July 14, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have completed the second project, reinforced my xml skills, learned a lot about how layouts work, and design the whole xml but keeping the project features. Using [Material Design](https://material.io/) I set a good color background for each view of this App.

**Thoughts:** I dedicated a lot of time on this, figuring out how to have everything properly fitted in the groupviews take me most of it. Setting the buttons behavior was actually fast since I have done it before in the Coffee-Ordering App, the only improvement I did with this is that I did three methods for six buttons instead six methods for six buttons.

## Day 4: July 15, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I learned how scrollviews work and how they are implemented, new Coffee-Order App Design and started to set it up in the xml file, the new features of this design includes a text field for the user's name, more coffees options, new toppings section, and lastly an order summary.

**Thoughts:** Having a scrollview opens many new design options, not worry anymore if all the content I want to make does not fit in a single view app. I felt like the xml file needed the comments that I commonly use for my C++/C#/Java/Python files to make everything more understandable, I searched on Google if there is a way and how do I implement them, then after find it I comment every element in the xml file, great relief to see all very organized and commented.


## Day 5: July 16, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The coffee-order app is finished, I had to used a [Nested Scroll View](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/NestedScrollView) instead the regular Scroll View because if you use one inside the other, when you use the parent one, the child will seem like its disabled or you will have trouble using it properly.

**Thoughts:** There's nothing better to see all your progress in one app, in the first chapter of this course (Android Basics: User Input). I thought the coffee-ordering app was finished, but after finishing the basketball app the next thing to do was to add some features to the coffee-ordering app, but that did not meant is was going to be only few steps. I design it in more depth and good a really good result!

## Day 6: July 17, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Almost finished the Android Basics: User Input course, the last thing to do is create a Quiz App. This last project is going to be about football/soccer, the project has been created and design is on paper, not it is time to pass the design to the xml file.

**Thoughts:** I've never thought this course was going to be this long, it is a lot of things that I've learned and can't wait to start the next one, [Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-multiscreen-apps--ud839).

## Day 7: July 18, 2018
**Today's Progress:** For every question in the Quiz App there will be an image and four possible answers, currently only one question has been tested. Styles have been implemented to make the xml file of the design more short and easy to read.

**Thoughts:** The Quis App design is simple, but strongly, using a single view without scrollview element is a great challenge, and it is what is up next, change the question text and image after the user has selected an answer.

## Day 8: July 19, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The Quiz App is one step to be completed, all the questions work perfectly, it is only left to set a resume of the Quiz, answers, good answers, bad answers and a reset button!

**Thoughts:** It is been a good challenge since I am constantly changing an image and the question text. I have seen other people's project of the Quiz App, all of the projects that I saw used a long scrollview with all the questions one next to the other. I thought it will be better to do it more simple for the user and a little more difficult to make but worth it. Hope to finish this project tomorrow and start with the Multiscreen Apps course!

## Day 9: July 20, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Finally the Quiz App is finished, it has 4 questions about football (soccer), and a Resume which contains a score, and the answered questions, if one of the answers was wrong it is detailed on the resume. Started the [Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-multiscreen-apps--ud839) course.

**Thoughts:** Each new app is a bigger challenge than the last one, it always has more new concepts. Now implementing new activities using intends, extends a lot of the things one can do in one App. This is one of the longest courses since it is expected to last 2 months, can't wait to finish this course and look back to all I have achieved.

## Day 10: July 21, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Learned about how to implement intends in order to use new activities, and learned how to use Listeners, an alternative way of onClick, that allows to do certain methods after the user clicks.

**Thoughts:** Is it really good to use listeners instead of only manage the clicks through the onClick component of the UI elements. Some post of Quora and Stackoverflow say they have the same performance, and some say that using listeners is actually better, for now I'll just follow what the instructor does, then I'll do more research.

## Day 11: July 22, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I had some problem today with my internet connection so I could not follow with the class today. But that could not stop me for learning, so I advanced more in the Java Tutorial certified course by SoloLearn App, learned about Handling Exceptions, Lists and HashMap.

**Thoughts:** I like to be a little more advanced on programming details in the Android course so I don't get stuck and get concepts quickly, I watched some videos on Youtube and saw the others student project of this course. Can't wait to do something similar to what I saw.

## Day 12: July 23, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Since I still have some problems with my internet connection I set some icon images for the happy birthday app, and the football quiz, fix some things that weren't working as expected at the last part of the Quiz App, nothing important but details that are always good to have them on point.

**Thoughts:** It seems that my internet connection is getting more stable now so I as soon as possible I am going to keep following the course.

## Day 13: July 25, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Learned and implemented Array, then change the Array for an ArrayList in order to not to worry about the data structure's size, how to add and get elements to this data structure.

**Thoughts:** I know how to use arrays but not ArrayList in Java, it offers some useful details.

## Day 14: July 26, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Create a class with its constructor, setters and getters, then use the ArrayList that I previously created but with the type of the class that I just created in order to store in that list the two translations (Miwok and Default). Then using an ArrayAdapter to manage much better the memory in order to see all the elements on the list of words. But then I created a class WordAdapter to replace that ArrayAdapter and implement better the adapter in order to see the two TextViews. It was a lot!

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will recap everything, it was a lot! I did not catch very well some details so I decided to stop, take a break and see everything more clearly tomorrow since I was learning a lot of things one after the other, and some of them I did not catch them at all.

## Day 15: July 27, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Yesterday a lot of things were covered, today I focused on doing a recap of everything and I almost finished. View Recycling process, the use of a ListArray with an ArrayAdapter, build the item on list layout used by the ArrayAdapter, creation of the Word class and why it is created was everything that the today's review could cover. It is left to review the custom Adapter for the List View

**Thoughts:** Today I did not see anything new, but It was important to review everything done in day 14, or almost everything. Important things were done and key concepts to catch, unfortunately maybe I was not focused enough that day and I did not catch at all everything. Happy to follow the instructor's advice.

## Day 16: July 28, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I reviewed how the Adapter for the List view works, update it in order to allow the list item to have an image, update the word class to store an integer that represents the id of the image, modify de layout of the list item in order to have a background color in each different section of the app. 

**Thoughts:** Today a big step has been done, I have had several days when I did not do much progress but todays I put a lot into it and finished a whole lesson.

## Day 17: July 29, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Lesson five is almost finished, the goal of this lesson is to manage audio features in order to hear the Miwok translation, it has been implemented but it is left to set the audio focus to have a more audio solid base.

**Thoughts:** This is not the topic that calls my attention the most, but it is actually really interesting and a lot of things to look into. Manage the audio of an app is not as simple as I thought.

## Day 18: July 30, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Miwok App is finished! But I started an Optional lesson that is really interesting where the Miwok App is going to change. This optional lesson is about refactoring the app with different design touches but keeping the its functionality, the first thing is to create a button in each activity that allows the user an alternative way to return to its parent's activity.

**Thoughts:** This course it's been the hardest to finish and keep up with everything, some lessons were really hard to catch but being constant and learn everyday thanks to this challenge has facilitate me to learn everything accordingly.

## Day 19: July 31, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Miwok App v2 is finished! This second version is the same Miwok App v1 but with different design, using Fragments, ViewPager and TabLayout. The only part that did not go as planned was the TabLayout, in the prototype project it worked but somehow it did not implemented well in the Miwok App. 

**Thoughts:** The 3rd course is almost done, it is only left to do the final project, maybe it will take two days, and then I will start the 4th course of the Android Basics Nanodegree program (I did not pay it but i am doing the courses for free).

## Day 20: August 1, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The tour guide app that I am going to make is going to be about Merida, Venezuela. I worked on the design today (on paper) and it is almost done.

**Thoughts:** I forgot how hard it is to create a project, or maybe for me, because I always try to create something very complete that includes every detail that I've learned so far and maybe something new. I always try to compare great similar apps on the play store and the other's project to my project and it is something that a lot of times makes me redesign the whole idea and try it to be the best. Maybe it is a bad habit for everything I do but sometimes it gets me great results.

## Day 21: August 2, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The app design is done. Today I was really busy but I got some time to advance in the SoloLearn Java course, I almmost finish it, it is left to learn about handling files (Read/Write files).

**Thoughts:** I don't believe the SoloLearn certificates are actually important, either way their lessons are really useful and it is always good to have certificates no matter how valuable they are.

## Day 22: August 3, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have create the main activity, and implement some base behavior of buttons to open a new activity, these buttons are layouts with a clickListener that contains one image (a representative icon) and a text. The main activity has three images of Merida that can be seen by swiping the current image to the next one.

**Thoughts:** I thought that it would take more time to do what I did, because it actually took several chapters of a lesson to learn each thing, but once you learned how they worked it is easy to use all that you have learned, even if you don't remember, taking a look of the code would instantly help and more if it is commented!

## Day 23: August 4, 2018
**Today's Progress:** SoloLearn Java tutorial finished. I created some fragments that are going to show a list of items, these represents hotels, restaurants, shopping, and entertainment places. An item class of this list is created, it has a basic information about the item, such as an image, the title, and the contact number. Lastly I created an adapter to control the item's information in a item layout that is going to be displayed by a ListView.

**Thoughts:** Happy to get another certificate, the app is really ugly but everything works by now, after I create every feature. I am going to dedicate a lot in polish the view of everything.

## Day 24: August 5, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The first two fragments are working with all its information, the listView of hotels and restaurants has all the information but every item has the same image since I am only worried about everything to be working, when I take care of the visual polish of the app I am going to change every item's image. A TabLayout has been added that indicates wich fragment is currently active.

**Thoughts:** Once I finished the fragments information, I am going to set the About information in the main activity, then the visual polish, and this project will be completed!

## Day 25: August 6, 2018
**Today's Progress:** All the fragments has all the information, I did some visual polish but also got some issues when setting the proper images for every item and the two categories that I implement the images are not running very smoothly. Every category has the same item layout but I am thinking about changing the Entertainment and Shopping item layout, make a different layout.

**Thoughts:** Many issues have showed up during the making of this project and I liked a lot since it has give me more experience on certain things that I should be more careful, and also implementing little details that were not learned in the course.

## Day 26: August 7, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The app is looking really good by now, I did some research about why using a ListView with image and scrolling through will not performance really smooth, the solution I will do it at the very end. I modify the listItem class including some more atributes such as location, schedule, and description of the item (Hotel, Restaurant, Shopping or Entertainment place). So the Hotels and Food Fragments has change a bit. Finally added some icons (images) that indicates location, schedule and contact number for the last two fragments that has a different adapter and xml layout.

**Thoughts:** It is funny how at the beginning I thought I was going to last two days, making a really complete app takes time, even though some days I did not do as much as I could but either way it was going to take some time to finish this project.

## Day 27: August 8, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The color of the name of the app and the back button of the second Activity in the ActionBar is changed, added all the pictures of the places in Shopping and Entertainment, set all their information (except the item's description), set some padding for all the texts that needed it. Realise that as the Views in the ListView are being reused, if an item does not have an information that another has that view is hidden, but, if this view is then reused with an item that has that feature that the past one didn't then it is not going to show up, so I have to verify that the each view of an item if not hidden before reusing them.

**Thoughts:** Everyday I realise something new, each stage of an app's development time, and key things that need to be set up and defined since the beginning in order to not be changing its design and losing sometime.

## Day 28: August 9, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Finally I have finished the tour guide app, it looks pretty good, added a cool tabLayout circle indicator for images in the main activity. Tomorrow I will upload the screenshots.

**Thoughts:** Every course's project is more complete than the last one and takes more time, It is really satisfying to see the results of all your work and sometimes you might get doubts if what you are doing is really worth it at the end, and it is definitely.

## Day 29: August 11, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I am not part of the Android Basics Nanodegree Program but still I can submit my project, it has been reviewed and today I have been fixing everything suggested, due to the bad internet connection I could not finish the last part of the things I have to fix, but for sure it will be ready for tomorrow. Started JSON Parsing lesson and saw some details about what we are going to be working in this new chapter.

**Thoughts:** It's been a month since I started this challenge and I could not be happier to see everything I have done. If someone that is not from Venezuela reads this probably may find hard to believe but yesterday I did not have internet connection, it was until today at 16:00 that I could continue learning from the Udacity course, and see the project's review.

## Day 30: August 12, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Create the Quake Report App with all the files provided, create a layout, and some classes in order to display more information about an Earthquake. Lastly see some videos about JSON components and how to read them.

**Thoughts:** Did not see the time and upload today's changes too late, now seems like I did not do anything, but whatever. Some things about JSON might seem confusing now but as I used them I will make everything more clear.

## Day 31: August 13, 2018
**Today's Progress:** In the Quake Report App, learned how to use JSONObject, JSONArray, and get objects from a JSONObject in order to get the primitive data required and create an Earthquake object with that information, and added to the ArrayList of Earthquakes. Check some projects of this course, just curious to see what I will achieve at the end of the course.

**Thoughts:** I always wondered about making an app and how would I be able to update its information somehow using internet connection instead updating the app, learning these new concepts clears a lot of doubts.

## Day 32: August 14, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Lesson one JSON Parsing is completed! I believe the Quake Report App is finished, it has simple TextViews that are managed using an adapter, it shows Earthquake reports, with a magnitude, location, and date. Magnitude has a very particular design with a background that changes its color depending the magnitude of the earthquake.

**Thoughts:** This lesson has been quite fast, I have learned important things, such as what is an API, thing that I did not mention before, I have seen something like Instagram and Twitter API before so it might be something interesting to investigate later on how to use it.

## Day 33: August 15, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Started Lessson 2 (HTTP Networking), create a Soonami project and set some text in the manifest file of the project in order to ask permissions and connect to the internet.

**Thoughts:** Could not do much today, I was kind of busy working, tomorrow I will try to finish what seems to be a short lesson.

## Day 34: August 16, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Finished Lessson 2 (HTTP Networking), learned components of how retrieving data from the internet and display it in an app, how to create, configure, and send http request using the HTTP URL class, then learned how to receive and parse the response, using a InputStream and convert that data using a InputStreamReader and a BufferedReader. Starting Lesson 3! Threads and Parallelism.

**Thoughts:** I believe this lesson could be better explained, it was a lot concepts and not a lot of practice, it was only editing and existing project and fixing some things, but either way I learned a lot, can't wait to use all this in the course's final project!

## Day 35: August 17, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Half of Lesson 3 (Threads and Parallelism) done. Today I learned about what is a threat, and create a project called Did You Feel It, running this projects makes the app crash. The logcat will show that an exception has happened and It will be because the networking connection should be done in the background thread, this will be fixed using the AsyncTask abstract class and creating an EarthquakeAsyncTask class, subclass of Asynctask. Also learned some common AsyncTask methods and if they occur in the main or background thread.

**Thoughts:** A lot of concepts, they are really important and they are giving me ideas for some future apps that I have in mind.

## Day 36: August 18, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I lost some time doing a quiz how I was not supposed to, many methods were already created and I was doing all the network request, parsing the data, etc. methods again when all that I had to do was to create a simple custom AsyncTask and do little changes into the doInBackground method. Now I have to apply all this into the QuakeReport App.

**Thoughts:** 
It was good to do all the methods even if it was not necessary for reinforcing all the concepts I have learned. I think it is not going to take me long to do all this into the QuakeReport App

## Day 37: August 19, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Finished implemented de AsyncTask to the QuakeReport App. Started the Material Design for Android Developers in order to create better looking future course projects! Discover that there is a bad part of using AsyncTask, since it may create more than one httprequest when rotating!

**Thoughts:** 

## Day 38: August 20, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Finished the QuakeReport App. Learned about loaders and the difference between a using loaders and AsyncTask. Set a loading animation while loading the list of earthquake, also setting textViews for cases when there might not have internet connection and it will display some information about it, also even if the app connects, but no information is received it displays a text saying that it has not found information about the earthquakes.

**Thoughts:** I was surprised when the instructors said that I finished the course, and there is still two more lessons, the thing is they are projects.

## Day 39: August 22, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Design on paper the simple Book Listing App and create all the xml files that are going to be used, set all the elements of the UI and finished the desired design with some icons and the search bar.

**Thoughts:** The edit text that handles the search of the book has some details that has to be fixed, such as set the max lines to one, and when the user taps enter, don't add a line, and by now, log a message.


## Day 40: August 23, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Created the BookAdapter that handles the ListView and the Book class that has three atributes (Title, Author, Year, Image Url). Started with some methods of the QueryUtils class.

**Thoughts:** I think I am doing this project in the wrong way, creating everything, and at the end do the real test and see if everything works.

## Day 41: August 24, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Finished the QueryUtils class, create the BookLoader class, as expected the app did not work, the EditText that gets the url does it correctly, checked by debugging it but it is failing maybe something wrong with the connection, I have to do some logs and check where it goes and where it stops.

**Thoughts:** I knew somehow I was doing this the wrong way, implementing loaders, query utils, and at the end test it all. 

## Day 42: August 25, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The Book Listing App is finished, it has everything required to submit it but tomorrow I will try to create a class that loads the book images and allow the user to tap on X book of the list and it will open the store that sells it.

**Thoughts:** It is very satisfying to see how things like adapters, loaders, and other things that at some point I find it really complex and hard to implement and understand, with practice now everything looks quite easy. I am almost half of the 100 Days Challenge done, and I can't imagine how much I will have learned at the end.

## Day 43: August 26, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Modify the book class in order to get the book's url and when the user clicks on a book, it opens it. Other's Book Listing App projects use Picasso that handles loading the images from an url in the background thread, it would like to do it without Picasso, I tried but I could not do it, I will ask on stackoverflow for suggestions. Create another Layout that is shown when there is not internet connection and implemented it properly.

**Thoughts:** I was surprised that I could not submit the project, because the other courses I could but the difference here is that this is not the final project of the course. The Android Basics: Networking course has two projects, and the last one can be submitted.

## Day 44: August 27, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Lesson Preferences started, added a Settings Activity for the QuakeReport App and added some strings in the strings.xml file. Learned about fragments, a little different from the fragments learned in the last course.

**Thoughts:** This lesson is introducing fragments, and it is implemented in the SettingsActivity class in a different way that I've learned in the last course and also in the xml file as <fragment>.

## Day 45: August 28, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Lesson Preferences finished, the QuakeReport App has a nice settings activity that has a PreferenceFragment subclass and implements Preference.OnPreferenceChangeListener. This activity has the option to change the way the ListView is sorted (Magnitude / Recent) and change min magnitude that the list will display.

**Thoughts:** Ready to start planning the final project of the course, this lesson was actually really interesting and could be very helpful for the final project.

## Day 46: August 29, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Read The Guardian API, this API will be used for the News App, the final project of the Android Basics: Networking course. Started to design on paper how the app should look, and the content that it will display.

**Thoughts:** I can't wait to start the last course of this Nanodegree, so I will do my best to finish this project as soon as possible implementing everything I have learned and maybe some new things that I have seen.

## Day 47: August 30, 2018
**Today's Progress:** In the Book Listing App I changed the Book Class, replace the "String image" with "Bitmap image", that way each book stores the image parsed from the jsonResponse image url. So I have to modify a bit the Adapter class, the list_item_layout xml and the QueryUtils class.

**Thoughts:** I know the way I changed the app in order to display images from the JSON response was not the best, because I believe the images are loaded in the Main Thread when it should be in the Background Thread, but I did not use an external library and it was what I intended, for now it should be good since it does not store too many images.


## Day 48: September 1, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Worked on a personal project that is going to use the Instagram API, it is not going to be shared since I want to publish it on the Play Store, I did some designs and I hope I start it when I finish the last course of Android Basics.

**Thoughts:** It is a simple project, not very innovative but it is a good point of start to gain experience publishing apps.


## Day 49: September 2, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The design of the News App is finished, created the Story Class and the Story List Item xml that shows the title, date, section, author of the story. Tested the layouts and the Story class by adding two Stories to a List<Story> and show them using a ListView and a Custom Adapter.

**Thoughts:** Now it is time to fetch the data from the internet, because all the information tested was already there in the project.

## Day 50: September 3, 2018
**Today's Progress:** QueryUtils Class is finished, it queries an url provided and fetch the data expected, also modified the Story class adding a String called url that will store a link that will allow the user access the full story when it clicks on the story item of the list.

**Thoughts:** I did not test the QueryUtils class, it is left to create the loader that is going to call the QueryUtils method. At first it will request data from a constant url in order to test that everything works, then start modifying the query url in order to request data for what the user wants.

## Day 51: September 5, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have not finished the project, I had some problems loading the Url request in the web browser using Chrome and Safari, so I practice the Uri and Uri.Builder to build the desired Query Url. Then I started the last course of Android Basics called Data Storage, learned how process data in a database using SQLite through the Terminal, create a table, how it is structured, how to insert, read, update and delete data. 

**Thoughts:** It is really important to know how to handle persistant data from your apps, because all this time every app that I have done uses data that lasts as long as the activity does, I picked an old project, the BasketBall App that I did a while ago and when the device is rotated the data it is lost. So little things like this can affect your app a lot and it is an essential to be prepared to handle this challenges.

## Day 52: September 6, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The News App project is almost done, the app is fetching the data correctly and it updates the ListView as expected, I struggled because there was an Error trying to do the connection because I was casting Http to HttpsUrlConnection, it did not happen in the class project (Quake Report App) because it was Https to Https.

**Thoughts:** Happy to encounter some errors that I will maybe face in the future. I did not debug the program as it should be (Debug Run), I did it by printing logs, in the future I will learn to do it accordingly using the Debug Run.

## Day 53: September 7, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The News App is finished! It is similar to the Book Listing App, it has the same features, the difference is that it handles different information from a different API in order to display Stories.

**Thoughts:** Happy to finish another course, a lot of things covered and a lot have to be polished as well. I hope I can practice a lot all I have learned in this course in a new project soon.

## Day 54: September 8, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Finished the first lesson of the Material Design for Android Developers, some key concepts of UI elements reinforced and learned a few new things. Started the second lesson of the Android Basics: Data Storage course about using a Database in an Android App, recap of what a schema is and learned what is a Contract class and why is it important to be defined.

**Thoughts:** I check the material.io website and notice that the plugin that they offer is available for the Sketch App, I hope in the Material Design for Android Developers I will learn to use it, if not I will check material.io if there are tutorials about it.

## Day 55: September 9, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Created the Contract class, and the Data Base Helper Class for the Pets App. Understand how both classes worked and how to use them, checked that everything is well implemented by checking the current tables in the Data Base, got some errors caused by dumb little but important mistakes that seem to be common in the future.

**Thoughts:** I did not advanced a lot in this lesson but did some important changes, fix some errors and undertand key concepts, it is important to keep learning everyday no matter how much it is.

## Day 56: September 10, 2018
**Today's Progress:** CatalogActivity class updated to insert "Dummy Data" to the data base, then modified the EditorActivity class to insert an specific data into the data base. Finally, understand how to query from the data base works using a Projection, Selection, SelectionArgs and Cursor.

**Thoughts:** Never thought all this could be this simple, maybe because it is really well explained. Checked the Data Storage Course Project and looks promising.

## Day 57: September 11, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Learned about what is a Cursor, its methods and how it should be used to read the information in the data base. Learned a bit of why SQL Injections might be dangerous and possible options to avoid it. First lesson finished and started the second.

**Thoughts:** Even though the Activity class in the second lesson is not going to access the data base directly, for learning porpuses was really good to do it in the first lesson to learn how it works, its disadventages and why a Content Provider should be used.

## Day 58: September 12, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Learned about why Content Providers are important, how they work, its essential methods, and created the ContentProvider class for the Pets App. 

**Thoughts:** It is really interesting how they can be used to share data with other apps, as it is explained in the course how the Contacts App information is shared to other apps such as gmail, facebook and twitter.

## Day 59: September 13, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Almost finished lesson 3, learned more about URIs and how they are used to access a defined table or even an specific row in the db's table. Learned what is an UriMatcher, why it is essential and implemented it. It is left to do the update and delete method of the PetProvider class and ensure that the data that is going to be saved is valid.

**Thoughts:** Did a lot today, learned a lot of things, took also many breaks in order to refresh my mind and don't collapse. Ready to continue!

## Day 60: September 14, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Lesson 3 finished, implemented the update, delete and getType method for the Content Provider class (PetProvider), ensure that the data that is desired to be saved is valid and finished the second lesson of the Material design course aswell. Learned about what is a MIME type and how to implemented it.

**Thoughts:** I thought this course would be longer, the Networking course has actually two projects and many Lessons so it is only one more lesson and the project!

## Day 61: September 15, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Started Lesson 4, Loading Data using CursorLoader, got an inside of what it is going to be about, it seems to be similar to the QuakeReport App methods to load everything from the internet but this time it is going to be from the data base.

**Thoughts:** Thought this lesson was going to be fast but videos are longer than expected, either way there is a lot to cover!

## Day 62: September 16, 2018
**Today's Progress:** CursorLoader implemented, create an empty view that is going to be displayed when the ListView is empty. Learned about CursorLoader, how to implement it and implemented its required methods in order to display properly all the data, the method called when it has to reset it and when the loader is created aswell.

**Thoughts:** Very similar to the Loader on the QuakeReport App, so concepts and implementations weren't hard to get.

## Day 63: September 19, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Due to some problems with Android Studio I could not keep doing code everyday. Today I did a recap of everything about CursorLoaders and continue the lesson, I changed succesfully everything in the Main Activity in order to load the data from the database in the background threat, algo start to modify the Editor Activity that will show a pet's information when the item is clicked on the Main Activity listview.

**Thoughts:** It is really frustrating trying to progress in this course while Android Studio keeps freezing the entire mac OS. It keeps happening and I hope I can do at least a little progress everyday.

**Thoughts:** It is really frustrating trying to progress in this course while Android Studio keeps freezing the entire mac OS. It keeps happening and I hope I can do at least a little progress everyday.

## Day 65: September 21, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Lesson 3: Surfaces (Material Design course) finished! Learned a lot very important details that will help to create a more intuitive and smooth user interface experience, such as surface, FAB, paper transformation and responsive to scroll events.

**Thoughts:** I am learning everything in a very general way, this course does not seem very detailed as the Android Basics courses but it is actually really good, when the moment to implement something I will look more deep into it.

## Day 66: September 23, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Lesson 4: Bold Graphic Design (Material Design course) finished! Learned about gestalt principle of grouping used to make design easily comprehensive, how to create a color palette and use the material.io color palette tool, typography, and lastly imaginery every important detail when using images in our apps.

**Thoughts:** I think this course is as important as the Android Basics but it is not well developed. Designing an app is a key part of app development, the way it looks is something that will make a huge difference if not handled properly; functionality is important but if the app does not look good, it might not catch the attention and some other better looking apps that have similar functionality will be more likely to succeed.

## Day 67: September 24, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Lesson 5: Meaningful Motion (Material Design course) finished! All kinds of transitions covered, and why is it so useful to catch the user's attention. Android Studio 3.2 downloaded!

**Thoughts:** This lesson was something I was really curious to learn about. I hope that the new Android Studio version is not going to give me freezing issues as the last one.

## Day 68: September 25, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Lesson 6: Adaptative Design (Material Design course) finished aswell as the course itself since this was the last lesson. Saw some examples of non optimal UIs aswell as some examples of optimal UIs designs, learned about breakpoints that set a point where the UI design changes if the screen size is bigger, and an introduction of standard things I can vary to make better use of my UI´s space.

**Thoughts:** Happy to finish another course, I can´t wait to apply all I have learned into my projects and the Data Storage final course project.

## Day 69: September 26, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Update some README files information, set up everything in the new Android Studio 3.2, Update a pet in the Pets App work as expected but now the app crashes when clicking the FAB to add a new pet. 

**Thoughts:** Really upset because for once I thought Android Studio 3.2 fix the error from the previous Android Studio version that freezes the whole Mac OS, forcing me to turn it off. It is very frustrating not being able to finish this course.

## Day 70: September 27, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have seen interesing things in the material.io website, I tried to use their plugin in the Sketch App by watching a video called Getting Started with Material Theme Editor but not useful at all, then I am following the [Developer Tutorials (Android Java)](https://material.io/collections/developer-tutorials/#android-java) and found some interesting alternatives of EditText with a different design, aswell for Button using a MaterialButton. Tutorial: [Java 101: Android Basics](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-101-java)

**Thoughts:** I did not do the tutorial on Android Studio since it is really simple, and I still have issues with the software. Since I can't use Android Studio for now, I will try to learn some design concepts, and watch some tutorials that don't require to use Android Studio or at least they are simple enough and there is no need to do everything that is done in the tutorials.

## Day 71: September 28, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Today I did the second Developer Tutorial in the material.io website about [Structure and Layout](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-102-java/#0). I learned about how to implement a Navigation Bar and reinforce a bit of how a menu is implemented aswell. Then, I find something that I have notice in others project, a MaterialCardView; a really smooth way to show information.

**Thoughts:** I have three projects in mind, and after doing every Developer Tutorial in the material.io website, I am going to design all those projects. There are a lot of things left to learn and I will try to to my best to learn everything I can without using Android Studio.

## Day 72: October 2, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Lesson 4: Loading Data Using CursorLoader (Android Basics: Data Storage) finished, this means that the Pets App is also finished, implemented the delete method for the MainActivity and EditorActivity, and some methods that prevents the app from crashing!

**Thoughts:** Android Studio was freezing my Mac because RAM problems, there was not more available RAM storage and Android Studio was requesting more causing it to freeze. Really happy to figure it out and almost finish the last course of Android Basics! It is only left to do the final project, the Inventory App.

## Day 73: October 3, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Today I looked some Shop Apps to get an example of how their UI looked, it is quite similar to the Inventory App, despite of being a simple design I got some good ideas. Design the most part of the UI design of the Inventory App and I also did a list of everything my app have to have in order to accomplish the Project Rubric.

**Thoughts:** 

## Day 74: October 4, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Days ago I check some tutorials suggested in the Material.io website but I did not do it fully since at that time I could not use Android Studio. Today I did the two tutorials that I did that day, many things learned, and many doubts aswell since the tutorial does not explain every detail.

**Thoughts:** These tutorials are good, you see how good looking you can make your app look, but it explain very generally. If I would rate these courses, I would give them a 5.5/10.

## Day 75: October 8, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I saw a lot of posts on stackoverflow to learn how to load an image from the Gallery, and it was more simple than some people thought, using an ImageView method that sets an image from an URI. I modified also the Contract class, in order to set another column in my database to store Strings, this Strings represent the URI that access a product's image stored in the gallery.

**Thoughts:** A lot of work left to do, I did many things despite I did not update the log.md file, because I want to do much more in Android Development and I don't want this challenge to end, but once I finish this I am going to create a respository about logs of Android Development, aswell as Game Development.

## Day 76: October 9, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I implemented the DatabaseHelper class, and checked that the MainActivity creates/reads the database. Created the EditorActivity, change a bit the design that I planned for this activity, and implement every component of it using the InputText and MaterialButton that I learned creating the Shrine app (Material.io Tutorials) and it is looking good so far. Lastly, I created the Appbar menu icons that represent Save/Delete data in the activity.

**Thoughts:** I am very happy with today's work, I spend more time than expected but worth it. I am probably going to change the PrimaryColor of the app.

## Day 77: October 11, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Change the design of the MainActivity, I was going to use a RecyclerView but the course assignment specifies I have to use a ListView, so I also changed the list item design and respectivly created the list_item.xml file. Then I created the Content Provider class and implemented query and insert methods.

**Thoughts:** It is funny how at the first two courses I was used to do a project in a day or two, after the course Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps everything became more complex and projects eventually took longer.
