# 100 Days Of Android Development - Log

## Day 0: July 11, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge.

**Thoughts:** Hope this will help me to get focused as far as possible.

## Day 1: July 12, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have completed the course Android Basics: User Interface recently, but did not do the project, so today I focused on doing it and try using EditTexts.

**Thoughts:** Include an EditText was easy, but I had to do some research to hide the underline and cursor when the user is not typing  for the first time.

## Day 2: July 13, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have completed the first project, a Coffee-Ordering App recently (Android Basics: User Input), but did not like the graphical final result, so I design a similar app with the same features, innovating with an image, more group layouts, and doing some research about the icon app, colors.xml and styles.xml

**Thoughts:** Importing images sometimes can't work well, when importing a really big one and set it to an ImageView I got some errors that took sometime to find what was causing the problem and fix it. Using the [Android Developer Documentation](https://developer.android.com/docs/) helped me to change the default colors of the top blue bar that every new android project has, creating a new feature called Toast, and setting up an icon app image.

## Day 3: July 14, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have completed the second project, reinforced my xml skills, learned a lot about how layouts work, and design the whole xml but keeping the project features. Using [Material Design](https://material.io/) I set a good color background for each view of this App.

**Thoughts:** I dedicated a lot of time on this, figuring out how to have everything properly fitted in the groupviews take me most of it. Setting the buttons behavior was actually fast since I have done it before in the Coffee-Ordering App, the only improvement I did with this is that I did three methods for six buttons instead six methods for six buttons.
