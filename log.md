# 100 Days Of Android Development - Log

## Day 0: July 11, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge.

**Thoughts:** Hope this will help me to get focused as far as possible.

## Day 1: July 12, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have completed the course Android Basics: User Interface recently, but did not do the project, so today I focused on doing it and try using EditTexts.

**Thoughts:** Include an EditText was easy, but I had to do some research to hide the underline and cursor when the user is not typing  for the first time.

## Day 2: July 13, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have completed the first project, a Coffee-Ordering App recently (Android Basics: User Input), but did not like the graphical final result, so I design a similar app with the same features, innovating with an image, more group layouts, and doing some research about the icon app, colors.xml and styles.xml

**Thoughts:** Importing images sometimes can't work well, when importing a really big one and set it to an ImageView I got some errors that took sometime to find what was causing the problem and fix it. Using the [Android Developer Documentation](https://developer.android.com/docs/) helped me to change the default colors of the top blue bar that every new android project has, creating a new feature called Toast, and setting up an icon app image.

## Day 3: July 14, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have completed the second project, reinforced my xml skills, learned a lot about how layouts work, and design the whole xml but keeping the project features. Using [Material Design](https://material.io/) I set a good color background for each view of this App.

**Thoughts:** I dedicated a lot of time on this, figuring out how to have everything properly fitted in the groupviews take me most of it. Setting the buttons behavior was actually fast since I have done it before in the Coffee-Ordering App, the only improvement I did with this is that I did three methods for six buttons instead six methods for six buttons.

## Day 4: July 15, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I learned how scrollviews work and how they are implemented, new Coffee-Order App Design and started to set it up in the xml file, the new features of this design includes a text field for the user's name, more coffees options, new toppings section, and lastly an order summary.

**Thoughts:** Having a scrollview opens many new design options, not worry anymore if all the content I want to make does not fit in a single view app. I felt like the xml file needed the comments that I commonly use for my C++/C#/Java/Python files to make everything more understandable, I searched on Google if there is a way and how do I implement them, then after find it I comment every element in the xml file, great relief to see all very organized and commented.


## Day 5: July 16, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The coffee-order app is finished, I had to used a [Nested Scroll View](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/NestedScrollView) instead the regular Scroll View because if you use one inside the other, when you use the parent one, the child will seem like its disabled or you will have trouble using it properly.

**Thoughts:** There's nothing better to see all your progress in one app, in the first chapter of this course (Android Basics: User Input). I thought the coffee-ordering app was finished, but after finishing the basketball app the next thing to do was to add some features to the coffee-ordering app, but that did not meant is was going to be only few steps. I design it in more depth and good a really good result!

## Day 6: July 17, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Almost finished the Android Basics: User Input course, the last thing to do is create a Quiz App. This last project is going to be about football/soccer, the project has been created and design is on paper, not it is time to pass the design to the xml file.

**Thoughts:** I've never thought this course was going to be this long, it is a lot of things that I've learned and can't wait to start the next one, [Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-multiscreen-apps--ud839).

## Day 7: July 18, 2018
**Today's Progress:** For every question in the Quiz App there will be an image and four possible answers, currently only one question has been tested. Styles have been implemented to make the xml file of the design more short and easy to read.

**Thoughts:** The Quis App design is simple, but strongly, using a single view without scrollview element is a great challenge, and it is what is up next, change the question text and image after the user has selected an answer.

## Day 8: July 19, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The Quiz App is one step to be completed, all the questions work perfectly, it is only left to set a resume of the Quiz, answers, good answers, bad answers and a reset button!

**Thoughts:** It is been a good challenge since I am constantly changing an image and the question text. I have seen other people's project of the Quiz App, all of the projects that I saw used a long scrollview with all the questions one next to the other. I thought it will be better to do it more simple for the user and a little more difficult to make but worth it. Hope to finish this project tomorrow and start with the Multiscreen Apps course!

## Day 9: July 20, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Finally the Quiz App is finished, it has 4 questions about football (soccer), and a Resume which contains a score, and the answered questions, if one of the answers was wrong it is detailed on the resume. Started the [Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-multiscreen-apps--ud839) course.

**Thoughts:** Each new app is a bigger challenge than the last one, it always has more new concepts. Now implementing new activities using intends, extends a lot of the things one can do in one App. This is one of the longest courses since it is expected to last 2 months, can't wait to finish this course and look back to all I have achieved.

## Day 10: July 21, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Learned about how to implement intends in order to use new activities, and learned how to use Listeners, an alternative way of onClick, that allows to do certain methods after the user clicks.

**Thoughts:** Is it really good to use listeners instead of only manage the clicks through the onClick component of the UI elements. Some post of Quora and Stackoverflow say they have the same performance, and some say that using listeners is actually better, for now I'll just follow what the instructor does, then I'll do more research.

## Day 11: July 22, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I had some problem today with my internet connection so I could not follow with the class today. But that could not stop me for learning, so I advanced more in the Java Tutorial certified course by SoloLearn App, learned about Handling Exceptions, Lists and HashMap.

**Thoughts:** I like to be a little more advanced on programming details in the Android course so I don't get stuck and get concepts quickly, I watched some videos on Youtube and saw the others student project of this course. Can't wait to do something similar to what I saw.

## Day 12: July 23, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Since I still have some problems with my internet connection I set some icon images for the happy birthday app, and the football quiz, fix some things that weren't working as expected at the last part of the Quiz App, nothing important but details that are always good to have them on point.

**Thoughts:** It seems that my internet connection is getting more stable now so I as soon as possible I am going to keep following the course.

## Day 13: July 25, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Learned and implemented Array, then change the Array for an ArrayList in order to not to worry about the data structure's size, how to add and get elements to this data structure.

**Thoughts:** I know how to use arrays but not ArrayList in Java, it offers some useful details.

## Day 14: July 26, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Create a class with its constructor, setters and getters, then use the ArrayList that I previously created but with the type of the class that I just created in order to store in that list the two translations (Miwok and Default). Then using an ArrayAdapter to manage much better the memory in order to see all the elements on the list of words. But then I created a class WordAdapter to replace that ArrayAdapter and implement better the adapter in order to see the two TextViews. It was a lot!

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will recap everything, it was a lot! I did not catch very well some details so I decided to stop, take a break and see everything more clearly tomorrow since I was learning a lot of things one after the other, and some of them I did not catch them at all.

## Day 15: July 27, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Yesterday a lot of things were covered, today I focused on doing a recap of everything and I almost finished. View Recycling process, the use of a ListArray with an ArrayAdapter, build the item on list layout used by the ArrayAdapter, creation of the Word class and why it is created was everything that the today's review could cover. It is left to review the custom Adapter for the List View

**Thoughts:** Today I did not see anything new, but It was important to review everything done in day 14, or almost everything. Important things were done and key concepts to catch, unfortunately maybe I was not focused enough that day and I did not catch at all everything. Happy to follow the instructor's advice.

## Day 16: July 28, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I reviewed how the Adapter for the List view works, update it in order to allow the list item to have an image, update the word class to store an integer that represents the id of the image, modify de layout of the list item in order to have a background color in each different section of the app. 

**Thoughts:** Today a big step has been done, I have had several days when I did not do much progress but todays I put a lot into it and finished a whole lesson.

## Day 17: July 29, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Lesson five is almost finished, the goal of this lesson is to manage audio features in order to hear the Miwok translation, it has been implemented but it is left to set the audio focus to have a more audio solid base.

**Thoughts:** This is not the topic that calls my attention the most, but it is actually really interesting and a lot of things to look into. Manage the audio of an app is not as simple as I thought.

## Day 18: July 30, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Miwok App is finished! But I started an Optional lesson that is really interesting where the Miwok App is going to change. This optional lesson is about refactoring the app with different design touches but keeping the its functionality, the first thing is to create a button in each activity that allows the user an alternative way to return to its parent's activity.

**Thoughts:** This course it's been the hardest to finish and keep up with everything, some lessons were really hard to catch but being constant and learn everyday thanks to this challenge has facilitate me to learn everything accordingly.

## Day 19: July 31, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Miwok App v2 is finished! This second version is the same Miwok App v1 but with different design, using Fragments, ViewPager and TabLayout. The only part that did not go as planned was the TabLayout, in the prototype project it worked but somehow it did not implemented well in the Miwok App. 

**Thoughts:** The 3rd course is almost done, it is only left to do the final project, maybe it will take two days, and then I will start the 4th course of the Android Basics Nanodegree program (I did not pay it but i am doing the courses for free).

## Day 20: August 1, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The tour guide app that I am going to make is going to be about Merida, Venezuela. I worked on the design today (on paper) and it is almost done.

**Thoughts:** I forgot how hard it is to create a project, or maybe for me, because I always try to create something very complete that includes every detail that I've learned so far and maybe something new. I always try to compare great similar apps on the play store and the other's project to my project and it is something that a lot of times makes me redesign the whole idea and try it to be the best. Maybe it is a bad habit for everything I do but sometimes it gets me great results.

## Day 21: August 2, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The app design is done. Today I was really busy but I got some time to advance in the SoloLearn Java course, I almmost finish it, it is left to learn about handling files (Read/Write files).

**Thoughts:** I don't believe the SoloLearn certificates are actually important, either way their lessons are really useful and it is always good to have certificates no matter how valuable they are.

## Day 22: August 3, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have create the main activity, and implement some base behavior of buttons to open a new activity, these buttons are layouts with a clickListener that contains one image (a representative icon) and a text. The main activity has three images of Merida that can be seen by swiping the current image to the next one.

**Thoughts:** I thought that it would take more time to do what I did, because it actually took several chapters of a lesson to learn each thing, but once you learned how they worked it is easy to use all that you have learned, even if you don't remember, taking a look of the code would instantly help and more if it is commented!

## Day 23: August 4, 2018
**Today's Progress:** SoloLearn Java tutorial finished. I created some fragments that are going to show a list of items, these represents hotels, restaurants, shopping, and entertainment places. An item class of this list is created, it has a basic information about the item, such as an image, the title, and the contact number. Lastly I created an adapter to control the item's information in a item layout that is going to be displayed by a ListView.

**Thoughts:** Happy to get another certificate, the app is really ugly but everything works by now, after I create every feature. I am going to dedicate a lot in polish the view of everything.

## Day 24: August 5, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The first two fragments are working with all its information, the listView of hotels and restaurants has all the information but every item has the same image since I am only worried about everything to be working, when I take care of the visual polish of the app I am going to change every item's image. A TabLayout has been added that indicates wich fragment is currently active.

**Thoughts:** Once I finished the fragments information, I am going to set the About information in the main activity, then the visual polish, and this project will be completed!

## Day 25: August 6, 2018
**Today's Progress:** All the fragments has all the information, I did some visual polish but also got some issues when setting the proper images for every item and the two categories that I implement the images are not running very smoothly. Every category has the same item layout but I am thinking about changing the Entertainment and Shopping item layout, make a different layout.

**Thoughts:** Many issues have showed up during the making of this project and I liked a lot since it has give me more experience on certain things that I should be more careful, and also implementing little details that were not learned in the course.

## Day 26: August 7, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The app is looking really good by now, I did some research about why using a ListView with image and scrolling through will not performance really smooth, the solution I will do it at the very end. I modify the listItem class including some more atributes such as location, schedule, and description of the item (Hotel, Restaurant, Shopping or Entertainment place). So the Hotels and Food Fragments has change a bit. Finally added some icons (images) that indicates location, schedule and contact number for the last two fragments that has a different adapter and xml layout.

**Thoughts:** It is funny how at the beginning I thought I was going to last two days, making a really complete app takes time, even though some days I did not do as much as I could but either way it was going to take some time to finish this project.

## Day 27: August 8, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The color of the name of the app and the back button of the second Activity in the ActionBar is changed, added all the pictures of the places in Shopping and Entertainment, set all their information (except the item's description), set some padding for all the texts that needed it. Realise that as the Views in the ListView are being reused, if an item does not have an information that another has that view is hidden, but, if this view is then reused with an item that has that feature that the past one didn't then it is not going to show up, so I have to verify that the each view of an item if not hidden before reusing them.

**Thoughts:** Everyday I realise something new, each stage of an app's development time, and key things that need to be set up and defined since the beginning in order to not be changing its design and losing sometime.
