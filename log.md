# 100 Days Of Android Development - Log

## Day 0: July 11, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge.

**Thoughts:** Hope this will help me to get focused as far as possible.

## Day 1: July 12, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have completed the course Android Basics: User Interface recently, but did not do the project, so today I focused on doing it and try using EditTexts.

**Thoughts:** Include an EditText was easy, but I had to do some research to hide the underline and cursor when the user is not typing  for the first time.

## Day 2: July 13, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have completed the first project, a Coffee-Ordering App recently (Android Basics: User Input), but did not like the graphical final result, so I design a similar app with the same features, innovating with an image, more group layouts, and doing some research about the icon app, colors.xml and styles.xml

**Thoughts:** Importing images sometimes can't work well, when importing a really big one and set it to an ImageView I got some errors that took sometime to find what was causing the problem and fix it. Using the [Android Developer Documentation](https://developer.android.com/docs/) helped me to change the default colors of the top blue bar that every new android project has, creating a new feature called Toast, and setting up an icon app image.

## Day 3: July 14, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I have completed the second project, reinforced my xml skills, learned a lot about how layouts work, and design the whole xml but keeping the project features. Using [Material Design](https://material.io/) I set a good color background for each view of this App.

**Thoughts:** I dedicated a lot of time on this, figuring out how to have everything properly fitted in the groupviews take me most of it. Setting the buttons behavior was actually fast since I have done it before in the Coffee-Ordering App, the only improvement I did with this is that I did three methods for six buttons instead six methods for six buttons.

## Day 4: July 15, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I learned how scrollviews work and how they are implemented, new Coffee-Order App Design and started to set it up in the xml file, the new features of this design includes a text field for the user's name, more coffees options, new toppings section, and lastly an order summary.

**Thoughts:** Having a scrollview opens many new design options, not worry anymore if all the content I want to make does not fit in a single view app. I felt like the xml file needed the comments that I commonly use for my C++/C#/Java/Python files to make everything more understandable, I searched on Google if there is a way and how do I implement them, then after find it I comment every element in the xml file, great relief to see all very organized and commented.


## Day 5: July 16, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The coffee-order app is finished, I had to used a [Nested Scroll View](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/NestedScrollView) instead the regular Scroll View because if you use one inside the other, when you use the parent one, the child will seem like its disabled or you will have trouble using it properly.

**Thoughts:** There's nothing better to see all your progress in one app, in the first chapter of this course (Android Basics: User Input). I thought the coffee-ordering app was finished, but after finishing the basketball app the next thing to do was to add some features to the coffee-ordering app, but that did not meant is was going to be only few steps. I design it in more depth and good a really good result!

## Day 6: July 17, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Almost finished the Android Basics: User Input course, the last thing to do is create a Quiz App. This last project is going to be about football/soccer, the project has been created and design is on paper, not it is time to pass the design to the xml file.

**Thoughts:** I've never thought this course was going to be this long, it is a lot of things that I've learned and can't wait to start the next one, [Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-multiscreen-apps--ud839).

## Day 7: July 18, 2018
**Today's Progress:** For every question in the Quiz App there will be an image and four possible answers, currently only one question has been tested. Styles have been implemented to make the xml file of the design more short and easy to read.

**Thoughts:** The Quis App design is simple, but strongly, using a single view without scrollview element is a great challenge, and it is what is up next, change the question text and image after the user has selected an answer.

## Day 8: July 19, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The Quiz App is one step to be completed, all the questions work perfectly, it is only left to set a resume of the Quiz, answers, good answers, bad answers and a reset button!

**Thoughts:** It is been a good challenge since I am constantly changing an image and the question text. I have seen other people's project of the Quiz App, all of the projects that I saw used a long scrollview with all the questions one next to the other. I thought it will be better to do it more simple for the user and a little more difficult to make but worth it. Hope to finish this project tomorrow and start with the Multiscreen Apps course!

## Day 9: July 20, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Finally the Quiz App is finished, it has 4 questions about football (soccer), and a Resume which contains a score, and the answered questions, if one of the answers was wrong it is detailed on the resume. Started the [Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-multiscreen-apps--ud839) course.

**Thoughts:** Each new app is a bigger challenge than the last one, it always has more new concepts. Now implementing new activities using intends, extends a lot of the things one can do in one App. This is one of the longest courses since it is expected to last 2 months, can't wait to finish this course and look back to all I have achieved.

## Day 10: July 21, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Learned about how to implement intends in order to use new activities, and learned how to use Listeners, an alternative way of onClick, that allows to do certain methods after the user clicks.

**Thoughts:** Is it really good to use listeners instead of only manage the clicks through the onClick component of the UI elements. Some post of Quora and Stackoverflow say they have the same performance, and some say that using listeners is actually better, for now I'll just follow what the instructor does, then I'll do more research.

## Day 11: July 22, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I had some problem today with my internet connection so I could not follow with the class today. But that could not stop me for learning, so I advanced more in the Java Tutorial certified course by SoloLearn App, learned about Handling Exceptions, Lists and HashMap.

**Thoughts:** I like to be a little more advanced on programming details in the Android course so I don't get stuck and get concepts quickly, I watched some videos on Youtube and saw the others student project of this course. Can't wait to do something similar to what I saw.
