# Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps
[Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-multiscreen-apps--ud839) is the third course of the five Android Basics courses. In the first and second course we created apps using a single activity, here you learn to implement more activities and how they connect one another. Also new concepts and features such as ListView, TabLayout, Fragments, Adapters, and more.

By the end of this course you will have develop two apps, and optionally an alternative version of the first one. The Miwok app and the Tour guide App (Final project). This and every other course includes screenshots of every app develop on a folder called screenshots.

## Miwok App v1
This app is about learning basic words of a language, each category has its Miwok and Default (English) translation. These categories are Numbers, Family Members, Colors and Phrases. When a word is clicked a sound is displayed that shows the pronunciation of the Miwok word.

## Miwok App v2
The second version is an optional lesson of the course that teaches how to use Fragments, in order to use only one activity and swipe between categories.

## Tour Guide App
This app is the course's project which is about use everything learned without someone to tell you step by step everything to finish it. You will have do design and implement everything in the app.
