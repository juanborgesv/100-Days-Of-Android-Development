# Android Basics: User Input
[Android Basics: User Input](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-user-input--ud836) is the second course of the five Android Basics courses. Learn to make your app more interactive by using buttons, and changing texts, reinforce xml, and get started with Java.

By the end of this course you will have developed one coffee-ordering app, a basketball score app and a Quiz App. Every project has its own screenshot folder, where you can see the course version screenshot which is what the instructor tell the students to do, and then there is my version with the same features but with my own design. If your are doing the course too I highly recommend you to do your own design of the projects, it will be very challenging and satisfying at the end.

## Coffee-Ordering App (v1)
This is the first app you will develop, order a coffee by clicking on the plus or minus sign, this updates a TextView that shows the quantity of coffees you are ordering. Depending on that quantity it calculates a total price value that will also update when you modify the quantity of coffees you desire to order. Finally, an order button that will pop-up a message saying that your order has been successfully registered, this was implemented using a Toast, feel free to do some research about this if you are interested because it is not implemented or explained in the course.


## Basketball Score Manager App
The second app is more challenging to develop but it reinforces the concepts explained before and the process that took you to develop the first project. This app consists in modify a Basketball Team Score using three buttons, +3 Points Button, +2 Points Button and Free Throw Button. You might guess what each button does, each one adds different amount of points to the current score, lastly there is a button that will reset the score. Seems different than the first project but at the end by using a Button you will change a TextView, just like the Coffee-Ordering App.

## Coffee-Ordering App (v2)
After finishing the Basketball App you will have to create a few more features for your Coffee-Ordering App, CheckBoxes for coffee topings, EditTexts for the user's name and an a order resume. The app that I develop provides five different coffees to order, four toppings, and a great order resume.

## Quiz App
The last app that is going to be develop is a Quiz App, it has to be about anything you like, and I chose it will be about Football/Soccer. Before making any app I like to see the others project and some real apps on the play store, so I can get different perspectives and possibilities in order to design a simple and useful app that covers the features requested. I did not want to do what every student's did for this project, an app with simple questions one next to each other into an scrollview, instead, I tried to do my App similar to many Apps on the play store, only after you answer the question, this disappears and the next one is shown.
