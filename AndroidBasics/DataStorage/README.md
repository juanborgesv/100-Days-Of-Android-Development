# Android Basics: Data Storage
[Android Basics: Data Storage](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-data-storage--ud845) is the last course of the Android Basics Nanodegree. In previous courses of the Android Basics Nanodegree, everything I have done in every app that I have built was gone after closing the app; now the goal is to store persistent data into the device, so after closing the app and then open it again, the data modified would still be there.

Only one app would be developed while learning all the concepts related to data storage, that is the Pets App, that stores relevant information about pets and shows all the data in a list.
