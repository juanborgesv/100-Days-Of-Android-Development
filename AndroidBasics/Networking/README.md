# Android Basics: Networking
[Android Basics: Networking](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-networking--ud843) is the fourth course in the Android Basics Nanodegree. Create apps capable of catching information from the internet.

By the end of this course you will have developed two apps several apps, but the most important ones are, Quake Report App, Book Listing App, and a News App. Each project has its own screenshots folder that are shown below.

## Quake Report App
This is the app that you are going to be doing while learning every detail. The Quake Report App shows a list of Earthquakes, every item in the list has detailed about an earthquake such as magnitude, location, and date; the list can be ordered by Most Recent or Magnitude, and also set a desired minimum magnitude. When an item in the list is clicked it opens a website with much more detailed information about the earthquake selected.

## Book Listing App
Unlike other courses this one has two projects, and if you are doing the course for free there is only one project that can be reviewed, and it is the last one. Book Listing App is a really good challenge, the app basically list books that relate to the Search bar text inserted; every item in the list has a book's image, title, author, and date. When an item is clicked, it opens the Play Store with a much detailed information about the book selected.

## News App
The final course project, a News App is not much different, it is very similar to the Book Listing App, it shows a list of stories related to the Search text specified; the main difference is that each app uses a different API to list different kind of content. Each item in the list shows the story's title, author, date, and section. When an item in the list is clicked it opens a website with much more detailed information about the story.
