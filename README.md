# 100 Days Of Android Development

## Overview
It is hard to start learning something new and even harder to develop a habit of study and practice that thing everyday. 100 Days of Android Development is an initiative that encourages the person to share its progress, and motivate himself to keep doing at least a little of research everyday. 
 
## Rules
* Make a public log of the work. Update it daily. Here is a Github example from the 100 Days Of ML Code initiative by [Siraj Raval](https://gist.github.com/llSourcell):
